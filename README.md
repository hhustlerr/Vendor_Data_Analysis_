# 📊 Vendor Analytics for Supply Chain Optimization
**Transforming vendor data into actionable supply chain insights**

---

## 🔹 Executive Summary
This project analyzes vendor performance to uncover **profitability gaps, purchasing concentration risks, and inventory inefficiencies** in the supply chain.  
Through exploratory data analysis and interactive Power BI dashboards, it identifies **top-performing vendors**, validates **bulk purchasing advantages**, and delivers **strategic recommendations** to strengthen procurement efficiency while reducing risks of over-reliance and unsold inventory.

---

## 🔹 Business Challenge
Organizations often face:  
- Loss-making transactions due to **negative gross profit**.  
- **Over-dependence** on a small set of vendors (top 10 vendors ≈ 66% of purchases).  
- **$2.71M locked** in unsold, slow-moving inventory.  
- Inefficient **pricing** and **bulk purchasing** strategies.  

These challenges reduce profitability, strain cash flow, and increase supply chain vulnerability.  

---

## 🔹 Project Objectives
- Analyze vendor performance across **sales contribution and profitability**.  
- Detect risks from **vendor dependency**.  
- Evaluate **bulk purchasing impact** on cost savings.  
- Recommend **actionable strategies** for pricing, procurement, and inventory optimization.  

---

## 🔹 Data Foundation: Preparation & Strategy
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed inconsistent data points where:  
  - Gross Profit ≤ 0  
  - Profit Margin ≤ 0  
  - Total Sales Quantity = 0  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  - Identified outliers in **pricing, freight cost, and stock turnover**.  
  - Found strong correlation (0.999) between purchase and sales quantity → efficient turnover.  
  - Found weak correlation between purchase price & profitability → other drivers affect margins.

## 🔹 Key Insights & Analysis
1. **Vendor Concentration Risk**  
   - Top 10 vendors contribute ~66% of purchases.  
   - Over-reliance increases **supply chain disruption risk**.  

2. **Bulk Purchasing Advantage**  
   - Large orders achieve ~72% lower unit costs ($10.78 vs higher in small orders).  

3. **Unsold Inventory Impact**  
   - $2.71M tied up in slow-moving stock → higher storage costs, reduced cash flow.  

4. **Profit Margin Differences**  
   - High-margin vendors average 41% but have low sales volumes.  
   - Top vendors average 31% margin but drive majority of sales.  

5. **Statistical Validation**  
   - T-tests confirm significant differences between high vs low-performing vendors.
